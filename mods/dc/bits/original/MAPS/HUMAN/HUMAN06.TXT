~1...LOG UPDATE...

~4I've been captured by the ~2ALIENS. ~4They put me in some sort of prison.

I can hear screams coming from all around me. What the heck are those bulbheads up to?

I've found a weapon next to what I think used to be a ~2TROOPER. 

~4There seems to be only one guard outside my cell...

I can't wait to see the look on his bug-like face as I blow it clean off.
